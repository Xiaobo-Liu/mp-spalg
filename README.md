# Multiprecision Schur-Parlett algorithm for general matrix functions without derivatives. 

Function `funm_nd` is a Schur-Parlett algorithm for computing a function of a square
matrix without using derivatives. It evaluates the nontrivial diagonal
blocks in the Schur form using randomized approximate diagonalization with
a diagonal perturbation.

The function works for an arbitrary function f at a square matrix A and
requires only the ability to evaluate f itself; derivatives are not required.

Function `test.m` runs a simple test of the codes.
